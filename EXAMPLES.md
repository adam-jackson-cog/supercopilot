## üìö Best Practices for Token Efficiency

### Choose the Right Mode
- **Analyze** (1,250 base): Understanding existing code, read-only assessment
- **Build** (1,225 base): Creating new functionality, code implementation  
- **Plan** (1,275 base): Strategic planning, specifications, roadmaps
- **Fix** (1,275 base): Problem resolution, debugging, optimization

### Optimize Switch Selection
- **Lightweight**: `--performance` (Fix mode: 1,575 total)
- **Medium**: `--feature`, `--prototype`, `--ux` (2,400-2,800 total)
- **Heavy**: `--bug`, `--prd`, `--architecture` (3,200-3,600 total)

### Effective Tool Combinations
```bash
# Research when needed
"Implement OAuth integration --feature --c7"

# Deep analysis for complex issues  
"Debug distributed system failure --bug --seq --ultrathink"

# Structured analysis with clarification
"Security review of authentication system --security --think"
```
