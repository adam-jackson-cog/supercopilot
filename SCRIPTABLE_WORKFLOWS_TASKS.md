## 🔮 Future Scope (Not Included in This Project)

**Remaining Chat Modes** (Future phases):
- **Build Mode**: 4 workflows (feature.md, prototype.md, tdd.md, plan.md) - 0% complete
- **Design Mode**: 3 workflows (ui.md, architecture.md, datamodel.md) - 0% complete  
- **Plan Mode**: 3 workflows (refactor.md, feature.md, prd.md) - 0% complete
- **Fix Mode**: 4 workflows (bug.md, performance.md, test.md, verbose.md) - 0% complete

**Note**: Build, Design, Plan, and Fix modes would require separate analysis to determine:
1. Which tasks could benefit from scripting vs pure LLM analysis
2. What types of scripts would be appropriate for each mode
3. How to balance automation with creative/strategic thinking
