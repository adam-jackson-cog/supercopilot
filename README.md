### Installation

**Automated (Recommended)**:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
./install.sh /path/to/your/project

# Windows PowerShell
.\install.ps1 C:\path\to\project
```

**Available Command Switches:**

| Switch | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `--force` | Skip confirmation prompts (automation) | `./install.sh ~/project --force` |
| `--update` | Update existing installation (preserves customizations) | `./install.sh ~/project --update` |
| `--uninstall` | Remove SuperCopilot from project | `./install.sh ~/project --uninstall` |
| `--install-mcp` | Install and configure MCP tools in VS Code | `./install.sh ~/project --install-mcp` |
| `--dry-run` | Preview installation without making changes | `./install.sh ~/project --dry-run` |
| `-h, --help` | Show help message with all options | `./install.sh --help` |

**Common Installation Scenarios:**

```bash
# Fresh installation with MCP tools
./install.sh ~/my-project --install-mcp

# Update existing installation
./install.sh ~/my-project --update

# Preview what will be installed
./install.sh ~/my-project --dry-run

# Automated installation (CI/CD)
./install.sh ~/my-project --force --install-mcp
```

**Manual**:

```bash
cp -r /path/to/SuperCopilot/github ./
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Requirements

### VS Code Settings

For optimal chatmode behavior, the installation includes:

- File creation enforcement (prevents code blocks in chat)
- Tool auto-approval for essential operations
- Extended request limits for complex tasks
- MCP and prompt file support

### Required Extensions

- GitHub Copilot
- GitHub Copilot Chat
- Any language-specific extensions for your target platform

### MCP Tools

Enhanced functionality through:

- **Context7**: Up-to-date documentation access
- **Sequential Thinking**: Complex problem analysis
- **File System**: Guaranteed file creation

## üéØ Best Practices

### Before Using Chatmodes

1. **Prepare Context**: Gather relevant information about your project, target users, and constraints
2. **Define Success Criteria**: Know what constitutes a successful outcome
3. **Set Time Boundaries**: Allocate appropriate time for the chatmode workflow
4. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure required tools and settings are configured

### During Chatmode Usage

1. **Follow the Workflow**: Don't skip phases or steps in the structured process
2. **Provide Complete Information**: Answer clarifying questions thoroughly
3. **Review Phase Outputs**: Verify each phase completes successfully before proceeding
4. **Document Decisions**: Keep track of choices made during the process

### After Chatmode Completion

1. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify all outputs work as expected
2. **Document Limitations**: Note any known issues or shortcuts taken
3. **Plan Next Steps**: Identify areas for improvement or extension
4. **Share Learnings**: Update chatmode files based on experience

## üîß Global Configuration

The framework includes a global `copilot-instructions.md` file that addresses common development issues:

- **Common Problem Resolution**: Guidance for frequent development challenges
- **Tool Integration**: Instructions for MCP server usage
- **Best Practices**: Development standards and conventions
- **Quality Assurance**: Guidelines for code quality and testing

## üìö Philosophy

SuperCopilot follows the principle of **focused specialization** through:

1. **Structured Workflows** - Each chatmode provides a systematic approach to specific tasks
2. **Speed Over Perfection** - Emphasis on rapid iteration and functional outcomes for prototype chat modes
3. **Platform-Specific Optimization** - Separate workflows for web and mobile development with appropriate tooling
4. **User-Centered Design** - Focus on understanding user needs and business requirements for ux prd creation
5. **Minimal Setup** - Streamlined installation and configuration process
6. **Team Consistency** - Shared workflows and standards across development teams
