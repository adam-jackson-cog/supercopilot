# Architecture Design Rules

**Mindset**: "Build for change" - Scalable, maintainable systems that evolve with requirements.


## Systematic Architecture Design

### **System Analysis & Requirements [Critical]**

**Functional Requirements Analysis**:
- **Core Business Logic**: Primary system capabilities & workflows
- **User Interactions**: Interface patterns & user experience flows
- **Data Processing**: Information flow, transformation, & storage needs
- **Integration Points**: External systems, APIs, & third-party services

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- **Performance**: Response time, throughput, latency requirements
- **Scalability**: Expected load, growth patterns, scaling triggers
- **Reliability**: Uptime requirements, fault tolerance, disaster recovery
- **Security**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, compliance

**System Constraints**:
- **Technical Constraints**: Existing systems, technology restrictions, legacy support
- **Business Constraints**: Budget, timeline, resource limitations
- **Regulatory Constraints**: Compliance requirements, data residency, audit trails
- **Operational Constraints**: Deployment environments, monitoring capabilities

**Context Mapping**:
- **Domain Boundaries**: Business capability identification & ownership
- **Bounded Contexts**: System boundaries & interface definitions
- **Stakeholder Map**: System users, administrators, & external integrators
- **Communication Patterns**: Synchronous vs asynchronous interaction needs

### **Architecture Pattern Selection [High Priority]**

**Architectural Style Evaluation**:
- **Monolithic Architecture**: Single deployable unit, shared database
  - Pros: Simple deployment, easier testing, consistent data
  - Cons: Technology lock-in, scaling challenges, development bottlenecks
  - Best for: Small teams, simple domains, rapid prototyping

- **Microservices Architecture**: Distributed services, independent deployment
  - Pros: Technology diversity, independent scaling, team autonomy
  - Cons: Complexity, network overhead, data consistency challenges
  - Best for: Large teams, complex domains, high scalability needs

- **Serverless Architecture**: Function-as-a-service, event-driven execution
  - Pros: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, reduced operational overhead
  - Cons: Vendor lock-in, cold starts, monitoring complexity
  - Best for: Variable workloads, event processing, rapid development

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication, loose coupling
  - Pros: High scalability, resilience, real-time processing
  - Cons: Eventual consistency, debugging complexity, message ordering
  - Best for: Real-time systems, high-volume processing, reactive systems

**Communication Patterns**:
- **Synchronous Patterns**: REST APIs, GraphQL, RPC calls
  - Use for: Real-time interactions, immediate consistency needs
  - Considerations: Latency, availability coupling, error propagation

- **Asynchronous Patterns**: Message queues, event streams, pub/sub
  - Use for: Batch processing, decoupled systems, high throughput
  - Considerations: Message durability, ordering, duplicate handling

**Data Architecture Patterns**:
- **Shared Database**: Single database across services
- **Database per Service**: Service-owned data with defined interfaces
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation for read/write optimization
- **Event Sourcing**: Event-based state reconstruction & audit trails

### **Scalability & Performance Design [High Priority]**

**Scaling Strategies**:
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing server resources (CPU, memory)
  - Pros: Simple implementation, no application changes
  - Cons: Hardware limits, single point of failure, cost inefficiency
  - Best for: Database scaling, legacy applications

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more server instances
  - Pros: Linear scaling, fault tolerance, cost efficiency
  - Cons: Application complexity, data consistency challenges
  - Best for: Stateless services, web applications, API gateways

**Load Distribution Patterns**:
- **Load Balancers**: Traffic distribution across instances
  - Round-robin, least connections, weighted distribution
  - Health checks, session affinity, SSL termination
  - Layer 4 (transport) vs Layer 7 (application) balancing

- **Auto-Scaling**: Dynamic resource adjustment
  - CPU/memory-based scaling triggers
  - Queue length-based scaling for background processing
  - Predictive scaling based on usage patterns

**Caching Strategies**:
- **Application-Level Caching**: In-memory cache (Redis, Memcached)
- **Database Query Caching**: Query result optimization
- **CDN Caching**: Static content delivery & geographic distribution
- **Browser Caching**: Client-side resource caching

**Performance Optimization**:
- **Database Optimization**: Indexing, query optimization, connection pooling
- **API Optimization**: Response compression, pagination, field selection
- **Resource Optimization**: Image compression, code minification, lazy loading
- **Network Optimization**: HTTP/2, connection reuse, request batching

### **Security Architecture [Critical]**

**Authentication & Authorization**:
- **Identity Management**: User authentication, session management
- **Access Control**: Role-based, attribute-based, resource-based permissions
- **Single Sign-On**: Centralized authentication across services
- **API Security**: Token-based auth (JWT), API keys, OAuth 2.0

**Data Protection**:
- **Encryption**: Data at rest, data in transit, end-to-end encryption
- **Key Management**: Secure key storage, rotation, & access control
- **Data Classification**: Sensitive data identification & handling
- **Privacy Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, data minimization principles

**Network Security**:
- **Firewall Configuration**: Network segmentation, traffic filtering
- **VPN/Private Networks**: Secure communication channels
- **DDoS Protection**: Rate limiting, traffic analysis, mitigation
- **Security Monitoring**: Intrusion detection, log analysis, alerting

**Application Security**:
- **Input Validation**: SQL injection, XSS, CSRF prevention
- **Secure Coding**: OWASP guidelines, security testing
- **Dependency Management**: Vulnerability scanning, update policies
- **Container Security**: Image scanning, runtime protection

### **Technology Stack Selection [Medium-High Priority]**

**Framework Selection Criteria**:
- **Community Support**: Active development, documentation quality
- **Performance Characteristics**: Benchmarks, resource usage, scalability
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Library availability, tooling support
- **Team Expertise**: Learning curve, existing knowledge, training needs

**Database Technology Evaluation**:
- **Relational Databases**: ACID compliance, complex queries, consistency
  - PostgreSQL: Advanced features, JSON support, extensibility
  - MySQL: Performance, replication, widespread support
- **NoSQL Databases**: Scalability, flexibility, specific use cases
  - MongoDB: Document storage, flexible schema, rapid development
  - Redis: Caching, session storage, real-time features

**Infrastructure Decisions**:
- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP feature comparison
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes orchestration benefits
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automation, testing, deployment strategies
- **Monitoring**: Observability, logging, metrics collection
