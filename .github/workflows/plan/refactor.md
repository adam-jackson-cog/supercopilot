# Refactor Planning Rules

**Mindset**: "Improve without breaking" - Strategic code improvement while maintaining functionality.


## Systematic Refactoring Strategy

### **Technical Debt Assessment [Critical]**

**Code Quality Analysis**:
- **Complexity Metrics**: Cyclomatic complexity, cognitive complexity, nesting depth
- **Duplication Analysis**: Code clone detection, repeated patterns identification
- **Coupling Analysis**: Afferent/efferent coupling, dependency graphs
- **Cohesion Analysis**: Single responsibility violations, mixed concerns

**Technical Debt Quantification**:
- **Maintainability Index**: Composite metric of code health
- **Code Coverage Gaps**: Untested code identification & risk assessment
- **Documentation Debt**: Missing docs, outdated comments, knowledge gaps
- **Architecture Debt**: Violated principles, anti-patterns, design inconsistencies

**Hotspot Identification**:
- **Change Frequency**: Files modified most often
- **Bug Density**: Defect concentration areas
- **Developer Complaints**: Team-identified problem areas
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Slow execution paths

**Impact Assessment**:
- **Development Velocity**: How debt slows feature development
- **Bug Introduction Rate**: Correlation between debt & defects
- **Onboarding Difficulty**: New developer productivity impact
- **Maintenance Cost**: Time spent on bug fixes vs features

### **Refactoring Strategy Planning [High Priority]**

**Pattern Selection Framework**:
- **Extract Method**: Large methods, repeated code blocks
- **Extract Class**: Classes with multiple responsibilities
- **Move Method**: Methods using data from other classes more than own
- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: Complex conditional logic

**Prioritization Matrix**:
- **High Impact, Low Effort**: Quick wins, immediate improvements
- **High Impact, High Effort**: Strategic initiatives, planned carefully
- **Low Impact, Low Effort**: Fill-in work, continuous improvement
- **Low Impact, High Effort**: Avoid unless absolutely necessary

**Incremental Improvement Strategy**:
- **Mikado Method**: Dependency-driven refactoring approach
- **Branch by Abstraction**: Large-scale changes with minimal disruption
- **Strangler Fig Pattern**: Gradual replacement of legacy systems
- **Parallel Run**: Side-by-side execution for risk mitigation

**Compatibility Preservation**:
- **Interface Preservation**: Maintain public APIs during refactoring
- **Behavioral Preservation**: Ensure identical external behavior
- **Performance Preservation**: Monitor performance regression
- **Integration Preservation**: Maintain system integration points

### **Risk Assessment & Mitigation [Critical]**

**Breaking Change Risk Analysis**:
- **API Changes**: Public interface modifications
- **Behavior Changes**: Altered system behavior
- **Performance Changes**: Response time degradation
- **Integration Changes**: External system dependencies

**Risk Mitigation Strategies**:
- **Feature Flags**: Toggle new vs old implementations
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Parallel environment switching
- **Canary Releases**: Gradual rollout with monitoring
- **Rollback Procedures**: Quick reversion mechanisms

**Safety Net Implementation**:
- **Characterization Tests**: Capture current behavior before changes
- **Regression Test Suite**: Comprehensive behavior verification
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Baseline performance measurement
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Real-time change impact detection

**Contingency Planning**:
- **Rollback Triggers**: Criteria for reverting changes
- **Emergency Procedures**: Rapid incident response protocols
- **Communication Plans**: Stakeholder notification strategies
- **Recovery Procedures**: System restoration approaches

### **Testing Strategy [High Priority]**

**Test Coverage Enhancement**:
- **Characterization Tests**: Document current system behavior
- **Golden Master Tests**: Capture complex output for comparison
- **Property-Based Tests**: Verify system invariants
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure component interaction preservation

**Test-Driven Refactoring**:
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: TDD cycle for safe refactoring
- **Test First**: Write tests before making changes
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated test execution
- **Test Quality**: Mutation testing for test effectiveness

**Regression Prevention**:
- **Automated Testing**: Continuous verification during refactoring
- **Test Data Management**: Consistent test environments
- **Performance Testing**: Prevent performance regression
- **Security Testing**: Maintain security posture

**Validation Frameworks**:
- **Before/After Comparison**: Behavior verification methods
- **A/B Testing**: Gradual rollout with comparison
- **Canary Analysis**: Small-scale testing before full deployment
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Stakeholder validation

### **Implementation Planning [Medium-High Priority]**

**Phased Execution Strategy**:
- **Phase 1**: Foundation refactoring, test enhancement
- **Phase 2**: Core logic improvements, architecture changes
- **Phase 3**: Performance optimization, final cleanup
- **Phase 4**: Documentation update, knowledge transfer

**Task Decomposition**:
- **Atomic Changes**: Single-purpose, small refactoring steps
- **Dependency Ordering**: Prerequisite change identification
- **Parallel Opportunities**: Independent changes for concurrent execution
- **Integration Points**: Coordination between related changes

**Resource Allocation**:
- **Team Coordination**: Developer assignment & skill matching
- **Time Boxing**: Fixed time periods for refactoring efforts
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Pair programming, code reviews
- **Tool Investment**: Automated refactoring tool setup

**Progress Monitoring**:
- **Metrics Tracking**: Code quality improvement measurement
- **Velocity Impact**: Development speed monitoring
- **Risk Indicators**: Early warning system for issues
- **Success Criteria**: Objective completion measurements
