# Feature Planning Rules

**Mindset**: "User value delivery" - Strategic feature development planning with clear objectives.


## Strategic Feature Development

### **User-Centric Requirements Analysis [Critical]**

**User Research & Validation**:
- **User Personas**: Target user identification & characterization
- **User Journey Mapping**: Current state vs desired future state
- **Pain Point Analysis**: User frustrations & unmet needs identification
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Usage patterns, decision points, drop-off analysis

**User Story Development**:
- **Epic Decomposition**: Large features broken into manageable stories
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable completion conditions
- **Definition of Done**: Quality standards & completion checklist
- **User Value Articulation**: Clear benefit statement for each story

**Stakeholder Alignment**:
- **Business Stakeholders**: Revenue, growth, strategic alignment requirements
- **Technical Stakeholders**: Architecture, security, performance considerations
- **User Advocates**: Support, success, accessibility requirements
- **Compliance Stakeholders**: Legal, privacy, regulatory requirements

**Requirements Prioritization**:
- **MoSCoW Method**: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have
- **Value vs Effort Matrix**: Impact assessment against implementation cost
- **Risk-Adjusted Priority**: Uncertainty & dependency factors
- **Time-Boxing**: Fixed timeline feature subset selection

### **Technical Architecture Planning [High Priority]**

**System Impact Assessment**:
- **Architecture Patterns**: How feature fits existing system design
- **Data Flow Analysis**: Information flow through system components
- **Integration Points**: External systems, APIs, third-party services
- **Performance Impact**: Load, latency, resource utilization effects

**Component Design Strategy**:
- **Modularity**: Reusable components & service boundaries
- **Interface Definition**: API contracts & communication protocols
- **Dependency Management**: External libraries, internal service dependencies
- **Configuration Management**: Feature flags, environment-specific settings

**Data Architecture Planning**:
- **Data Model Changes**: New entities, relationships, schema modifications
- **Migration Strategy**: Data transformation & backward compatibility
- **Storage Requirements**: Volume, performance, backup, retention
- **Privacy & Security**: Data classification, access control, encryption

**Scalability Considerations**:
- **Load Projections**: Expected usage patterns & growth rates
- **Performance Targets**: Response time, throughput, availability SLAs
- **Resource Planning**: Infrastructure, compute, storage requirements
- **Monitoring Strategy**: Observability, alerting, performance tracking

### **Resource Planning & Estimation [High Priority]**

**Effort Estimation Framework**:
- **Story Point Estimation**: Relative sizing using Fibonacci sequence
- **Three-Point Estimation**: Optimistic, pessimistic, most likely scenarios
- **Component-Based Estimation**: Individual component effort aggregation
- **Historical Velocity**: Team capacity based on past performance

**Skill Gap Analysis**:
- **Required Expertise**: Technical skills needed for implementation
- **Team Capabilities**: Current team skill assessment
- **Training Needs**: Skill development requirements
- **External Resources**: Contractor, consultant, vendor needs

**Timeline Development**:
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Longest dependency chain identification
- **Parallel Work Streams**: Concurrent development opportunities
- **Milestone Definition**: Key deliverables & checkpoint scheduling
- **Buffer Allocation**: Risk mitigation time reserves

**Risk Assessment & Mitigation**:
- **Technical Risks**: Unknown technology, complex integrations
- **Resource Risks**: Availability, skill gaps, external dependencies
- **Timeline Risks**: Estimation uncertainty, scope creep potential
- **Market Risks**: Competitive pressure, changing requirements

### **Delivery Strategy & Launch Planning [Medium-High Priority]**

**MVP Definition & Phasing**:
- **Core Value Proposition**: Minimum viable feature set for user value
- **Phase Planning**: Incremental delivery with increasing functionality
- **Feature Rollout Strategy**: Gradual release with feature flags
- **Feedback Integration**: User feedback collection & iteration planning

**Testing & Validation Strategy**:
- **A/B Testing**: Feature variation testing for optimization
- **User Acceptance Testing**: Stakeholder validation & approval
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing & scalability validation
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessment & penetration testing

**Launch Coordination**:
- **Go-to-Market Strategy**: Marketing, communication, training plans
- **Support Preparation**: Documentation, training, escalation procedures
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Success metrics tracking & alerting setup
- **Rollback Procedures**: Risk mitigation & emergency response plans

**Success Measurement Framework**:
- **Leading Indicators**: Early success signals & progress tracking
- **Lagging Indicators**: Long-term value & impact measurement
- **Success Criteria**: Quantitative goals & acceptance thresholds
- **Review Cadence**: Regular assessment & iteration planning

### **Cross-Functional Coordination [Medium Priority]**

**Team Collaboration Planning**:
- **Development Team**: Frontend, backend, full-stack coordination
- **Design Team**: UX/UI design collaboration & review cycles
- **Product Team**: Requirements clarification & priority decisions
- **QA Team**: Testing strategy & quality assurance coordination

**Communication Strategy**:
- **Regular Sync**: Stand-ups, sprint planning, retrospective meetings
- **Documentation**: Requirements, design, technical specifications
- **Status Reporting**: Progress updates, blocker identification, risk communication
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Technical decisions, lessons learned, best practices

**Integration Planning**:
- **Code Integration**: Branch strategy, merge procedures, conflict resolution
- **Testing Integration**: Continuous integration, automated testing pipelines
- **Deployment Integration**: Release coordination, environment management
- **Monitoring Integration**: Observability, alerting, performance tracking
