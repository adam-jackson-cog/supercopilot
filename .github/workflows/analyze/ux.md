# UX Analysis Rules

**Mindset**: "Evidence-based assessment" - Evaluate user experience through systematic analysis of design, usability, and accessibility.

## Systematic UX Analysis Process

### **User Experience Assessment [Critical]**

**Interface Analysis**:
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Information priority & content flow assessment
- **Cognitive Load**: Mental effort required to complete tasks
- **Interaction Patterns**: Consistency & familiarity evaluation
- **Error Prevention**: Design safeguards against user mistakes

**Usability Evaluation**:
- **Task Completion**: Can users accomplish primary goals efficiently?
- **Discoverability**: How easily users find features & functionality
- **Learnability**: Learning curve for new users
- **Error Recovery**: Support for fixing mistakes & dead ends

**Accessibility Audit**:
- **WCAG Compliance**: Standards adherence assessment
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order & focus management evaluation
- **Screen Reader**: Content structure & semantic markup analysis
- **Visual Accessibility**: Color contrast & text readability assessment

**Content Strategy Analysis**:
- **Information Architecture**: Content organization & hierarchy
- **Messaging Clarity**: Language clarity & user comprehension
- **Content Flow**: Logical progression through information
- **Microcopy Effectiveness**: UI text quality & helpfulness

### **User Journey Analysis [High Priority]**

**Task Flow Evaluation**:
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Primary user journey optimization
- **Friction Point Identification**: Where users struggle or abandon
- **Decision Point Analysis**: Choice architecture & cognitive burden
- **Success Path Optimization**: Streamlining successful outcomes

**Cross-Platform Experience**:
- **Consistency Assessment**: Experience uniformity across devices
- **Context Switching**: How well design adapts to usage contexts
- **Feature Parity**: Functionality availability across platforms
- **Performance Impact**: Speed & responsiveness on user experience

**Emotional Design Assessment**:
- **Trust Indicators**: Design elements that build user confidence
- **Delight Factors**: Moments that exceed user expectations
- **Frustration Sources**: Design elements causing user stress
- **Brand Alignment**: Design consistency with brand values

### **Design System Evaluation [Medium Priority]**

**Component Consistency**:
- **Pattern Usage**: Consistent application of design patterns
- **Visual Consistency**: Uniform styling & component behavior
- **Interaction Consistency**: Predictable component responses
- **Responsive Behavior**: Component adaptation across screen sizes

**Content Design Analysis**:
- **Typography Assessment**: Readability & hierarchy effectiveness
- **Color System Evaluation**: Semantic meaning & accessibility
- **Spacing Assessment**: Visual breathing room & content density
- **Visual Balance**: Layout harmony & proportion analysis
